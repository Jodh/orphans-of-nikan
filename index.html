  <h3>Political History</h3>
<p>A large country surrounded by the cold hinterlands on the north, a sea on the west. 
  Before Nikan was an empire, it was a collection of small monastic peoples. Then a millennia ago 
  the Red Emporer slowly conquered half the continent including Nikan. He established a common language, 
  built roads and generally introduced modern technology into the region. 
  This resulted in the homogenization of the region. The current Nikaran Empire consists of 12 provinces 
  each ruled by a warlord. Some provinces are vassals to other provinces so the actual number of political 
  linchpins is usually lower than 12. Some warlords are kings by name only and have no actual power. 
  Regardless, each province answers to the current Empress of Nikan, Su Daji. Empress Su Daji has a tenuous 
  hold on all the rivalling warlords. There are pockets of regions that see no administrative control by 
  the crown due to various factors. The two biggest reasons being, one, not enough man power and two, 
  the regions are too remote and hold very little natural resources to exploit.</p>
<h3>Theology and Magic</h3>
<p>Most Nikarans practice rituals and pay lip service to the various local gods of their respective province. 
  Temples usually house statues and symbols of most of the pantheon. Smaller temples usually house only 
  the local god and the trio of Turtle (the creator), the Dragon (the preserver) and 
  the Phoenix (the destroyer). The gods manifest their power through avatars and saints. 
  Many modern scholars believe that the gods are just sources of energy to be used and have no 
  will of their own. The source of power of the gods is magic, and many great warriors of the 
  past and present bypassed gods and directly channeled magic, reducing the reliance on gods 
  for the modern people. Both Magic and divinity is taught exclusively to the ruling class 
  and their agents only, although there are some who independently practice it.</p>
<h3>Demography</h3>
<p>For the purpose of creating characters with any ancestry and class. All ancestories can be found on the mainland of Nikan.
  They may vary in ratios in the different provinces due to ancestral ties and climates. Only Memnoks and Time Raiders are recent additions
  to Nikan and can be considered "forgein" as they come form the far western nations like Adrun. The skills represented by all the nine core
  classes of Draw Steel are practiced to some degree in each province of Nikan. Further details may be found in the Province section of this primer.

<h3>Nikan Provinces</h3>
<img src="images/Nikan-provinces.png"/>
<ul>
<li>Dragon</li>
<ul> 
<li>Major Cities: Sinegard</li>
<p> The Summer capital of Nikan, Sinegard, resides in the Dragon province. The
city of Sinegard also houses the Nikan Empire's most prestigous military training
academy, The Royal Sinegard Academy. The students of this academy go on to become
officers, diplomats and generals in the Nikaran Military. 
To some it is an escape from poverty, to others a means to gain political 
leverage and to some a matter of family pride. 
Everyone is equal once they enter the grounds of Sinegard Academy, in theory. Realistically,
social divisions and favouratism still exist due to there being a ruling and serf
class in actual Nikaran society.</p>
<li>Major Industries: Service Sector, Jewelcraft, Fishing, Education</li>
<li>Major Ancestories: Devil, Human</li>  
</ul>  
<li>Ram</li>
<ul>
<li>Major Cities: Khurdalain</li>
<p>The Ram province along with the Horse province form the southern-Hinterlands.
Vast open platues with sparse resources and a nomadic horse and Yak herding population.
The region is served by many small cold streams of water that emerge from the moutains
in the northern Hinterlands. Khurdalain is a major port city that serves as an urban
center for both the Ram and Horse Provinces. Although the Ram Warlord holds complete
political and economical control of Khurdalain. The Horse warlord is a vassal of the Snake merchant
Prince and a solid pawn in the efforts of the Snake province to gain control of the wool and fishing industry 
in Khurdalain.</p>
<li>Major Industries: Fishing, Wool, Animal Husbandry, Textile</li>
<li>Major Ancestories: Orc, Dragon Knight</li> 
</ul>
<li>Horse</li>
<ul>
<li>Major Cities: Khurdalain</li>
<p>Although Khurdalain is shared by the two provinces of Ram and Horse, it is mainly
a Ram province city. The warlord of Horse Province prefers not to have urban centers
and wishes to maintain the pre-Red Emporer traditions of his people. Scholars do argue
that any tradition preserved would have been heavily modified by the one thousand year
control of the Nikaran Empire after the Red Emporer but the Horse warlord chooses to 
dismiss such claims. Currently this independence comes at the cost of paying tribute to the Snake Merchant Prince. 
The people of the Horse province are a collection of expert riders, hunters 
and spiritualists.</p>

<h2>Federation of Mugen</h2>
  <p>The Federation of Mugen used to be a Nikan colony during the era of the Red Emperor. 
    But soon after the death of the Red Emperor, its provinces fell into a power struggle allowing 
    the small island nation of Mugen to achieve independence. After independence the Federation of 
    Mugen quickly industrialised under a pragmatic ruler and became highly militaristic. 
    The growing population and low landmass made Mugen eye the former Nikan Empire colonists as a 
    fertile place to capture and expand into. They set up a trading outpost on the coast of Nikan 
    in the Snake province in order to get a foothold in the mainland. Eventually growing bold enough 
    to field squads that frequently skirmished with the less trained and organized soldiers of the 
    Nikan Empire. This finally culminated in a full blown war.
